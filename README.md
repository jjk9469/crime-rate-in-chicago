# crime-rate-in-chicago

Chicago violent crime rates have been in the news lately and none of these news were good. Both national and local news outlets have published numerous
articles highlighting the alarmingly high numbers of violent crimes in the city. In preparation to the upcoming meeting with a very well-known real estate
developer, my team has been hired to provide honest, unbiased assessment of Chicago crime rates. This is the opportunity to tell the story on how dangerous
(or not) Chicago has become in the last year, but must support your story with quantitative insights.

Real estate developer and his team just wants to see a real, data-driven assessment of Chicago crime rates. 
Chicago Crimes dataset is over 6M records (way too big for Excel), therefore I have used KNIME to pre-process the data and used Tableau to visualize the results.
